    </p><strong>You'll need the following ingredients:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Some butter/oil for the pan</li>
        <li>75 g (¾ cup) white breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>500 g (18 oz) ground beef/pork mixture</li>
        <li>250 ml (1¼ cup) milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>ground allspice</li>
    </ul><p>
    <br> <strong>Steps to cook this badboy</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the breadcrumbs in milk, for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime dice the onion and fry gently in a little butter/olive oil without browning.</li>
        <li>Blend the ground meat mixture with the onion, egg, milk/breadcrumb mixture and the spices.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper. Continue blending for about 5-10 minutes.
            Add a little water if the mixture feels too firm.
            Check the taste by test-frying one meatball.</li>
        <li>Then shape small meatballs with the aid of two spoons or with your hands – it’s easier if you smear some butter in your hands to make the raw meatballs stick less. Place on clean plates.</li>
        <li>Brown a pat of butter in a frying pan, and as soon as it ‘goes quiet’ place the meatballs in the pan and let them brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Shake the frying pan regularly.</li>
        <li>Fry until meatballs have the desired color.</li>
